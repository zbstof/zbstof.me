A: Who are you?

B: I am B

A: How do you know that?

B: That's what is written in my birth certificate

A: How do you know that?

B: I remember reading it

A: How do you know that?

B: I have an immediate perception of memory of that event*

A: How can you base the knowledge of yourself on "your" perception? That's circular. Those could be someone else's perceptions. Who are you then?

B: The thing that percieves the perceptions - whomever they belong to

A: What characteristics does the thing that percieves has?

B: it is total, all encompassing, because it includes all perceptions. Perceptions don't exist if they are not perceived*. It is without defect or lack. Because deficiency is the thing being perceived, not thing doing the perceiving. You could say it is without characteristics.

A: is this perceiver a process, what is its relationship to time?

B: it's not influenced by time, because time is again a thing being perceived be perceiving perception of change. It's not a process, because all processes are only possible by changes in time. You could say the perceiver is timeless.

A: if the perceiver is timeless and featureless, why are you talking about it as if it was a thing?

B: you're right, it's more of a no-thing, nothing. So I am nothing.

A: Does it make sense to say "I think, therefore I exist" if "I" is no-thing?

B: it would make sense to say instead "thought is percieved by no-thing" or shorter: "there is a thoght"

A: so you equate knowledge of existence with perception (there is = is percieved)?

B: this is the only way you can be sure. Other ways of thinking are just conjectures.

A: would this this line of reasoning hold for everybody?

B: I don't see how it could not. Everybody is no-thing.

A: is this the same no-thing?

B: it has exactly the same lack of characteristics, so it makes no sense to pose existence of several no-things. It should be the same no-thing for everybody. Everybody is the same no-thing.

A: How far away are the things being perceived?

B: perceptions are immediate, there's no distance to them. Distance would be just another perception being perceived immediately. All perceptions are perceived directly, as they are, without intermediary.

A: is there any dividing line between perceptions?

B: any division would be just another perception arising (perceived by no-thing). So all perceptions are parts of unified whole. It makes sense to talk about the field of perception.

A: are there things outside this field of perception?

B: thinking there are things outside the field of perception is just another perception arising in the field of perception. Thus the field of perception contains everything. That's the only thing that can be sure of. So there is no separate things, just perceptions of separate things arising in the unified whole.

A: but if you are no-thing and the field of perception contains everything, doesn't it contain the perception of no-thing? What happens when no-thing perceives no-thing?

B: It's the deepest mystery. Words are useless to describe it.
